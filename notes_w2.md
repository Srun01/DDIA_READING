# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Week 2

### Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

#### Reliablility

- Hardware Faults
- Software Errors
- Human Errors

From hardware to human, the possibility of problems is more likely to happen. So, reliability is not just for nuclear, but everywhere. We need to consider more when the application closes to people.



#### Scalability

- Load: requestes/minutes.
- Performance: percentile is a better way to measure it.

Scalability is how we improve performance to cope with increasing load.



#### Maintainability

The core thingking about maintainability is all about how you deal with human:

- Operability: Easy for **Operation teams**
- Simplicity: Easy for **New engineers**
- Evolvability: Easy for **Engineers to Change**
